              This website was created with the purpose of showcasing my logo
              creations which were developed for both university projects as

              Although logo creation is a personal hobby of mine, these logos
              have been and are currently being used for personal projects,
              businesses and communities. Each logo has its own unique story to
              tell, so feel free to observe! Note: the polygonal framing is just
              used for design, and is not part of the logos.

              Lets take a little "expedition" into the story of this logo. As
              part of a university project, it was required to create an
              innovative solution for the travel industry during the Covid
              Pandemic. My group's solution was a virtual reality headset that
              allows the user to undergo online expeditions at any tourist
              destination around the world.
            </p>
            <p class="ea-p">
              This heavily inspired the name of the company to be "Xpedition".
              In order to fit the company name, I created a logo in the shape of
              the letter "x". The thick diagonal line in the logo represents the
              shape of the virtual realtiy headset that my group and I
              protoyped.

              Prioritask. A word combination of priority and task. This name was
              created for a future personal project of an automatic
              timetable/organisation application for students with busy study
              schedules.

              This logo was designed in procreate. I tried to create a logo that
              is simple, one that matches the theme of organising tasks, as well
              as representing the name.

              The UTS Business discord is a community with over 1000 students in
              the UTS business faculty. In 2021, I was the co-owner of this
              server and helped other students in subjects related to this
              course.

              I created the official logo for this community, which is still in
              use today. It is a simple, yet sleek design and is representative
              of UTS through the blue colour scheme.
